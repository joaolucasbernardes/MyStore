My Store

This project is an e-commerce web application called MyStore, developed to simulate an online store. The system manages entities such as users, products, categories, and orders, including the status of each order. The entire application is built using Java 17 and the Spring Boot framework, which includes Spring Web for creating REST endpoints and Spring Data JPA for data persistence. The project uses Maven for dependency management and the H2 in-memory database for the testing environment.
